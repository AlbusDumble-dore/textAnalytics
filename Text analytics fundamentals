# At a minimum we need to split our data into a training set and a

# of training, validation, and test.

# As we know that our data has non-trivial class imbalance, we'll 
# use the mighty caret package to create a randomg train/test split 
# that ensures the correct ham/spam class label proportions (i.e., 
# we'll use caret for a random stratified split).
